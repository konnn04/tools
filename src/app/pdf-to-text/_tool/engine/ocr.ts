/**
 * OCR — docs/roadmap/01-pdf-to-text.md §5, "tesseract.js kéo theo WASM + gói
 * ngôn ngữ nặng, phải tự host và tải lười". Every asset tesseract.js touches
 * (`workerPath`, `corePath`, `langPath`) is pinned to `browser.runtime.getURL`
 * paths under `public/tesseract-assets/` — never the jsdelivr CDN it falls
 * back to when these are left unset. `workerBlobURL: false` matters just as
 * much as the paths themselves: left at its default (true), tesseract.js
 * fetches `workerPath` and re-launches it from a `blob:` URL, and this
 * extension's CSP (`script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'`) does not list
 * `blob:` — `false` makes it `new Worker(workerPath)` directly instead, a
 * same-origin `chrome-extension://…` script the CSP already allows.
 *
 * Only the LSTM engine build is self-hosted (tesseract.js 5+ dropped the
 * legacy OEM anyway), and only `eng`/`vie` language data is vendored — see
 * docs/site/03-pdf-to-text.md.
